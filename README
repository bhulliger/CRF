This framework allows to render OSG (OpenSceneGraph, www.openscenegraph.org) applications with Equalizer (www.equalizergraphics.com). For further explanations,
some examples, a technical report and a user guide should come along with the code.

This simple framework is based on eqOSG - a minimal example published by 
the University of Siegen, 2009.
