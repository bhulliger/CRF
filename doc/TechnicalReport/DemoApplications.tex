\chapter{Demo Applications}

The \gls{crf} package comes with some demo applications to demonstrate the functionalities of the framework. The following list gives an overview of these applications and their purpose:

\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{crfHelloWorld}]\hfill\\
		The purpose of this very simple application is to test if the CRF is installed and running properly. Since it is a very slim and simple application, it can be used to test Equalizer configuration files. The application simply shows the word \texttt{OSG} written in light blue flickering letters. One can load any desired \texttt{*.osg} model files by adding the following parameter: \texttt{--model=<filename>}. Screenshots can be found in the Appendix \ref{sec:appendixHelloWorld}.
	\item[\texttt{crfShaderDemo}]\hfill\\
		The sole purpose of this demo application is to verify whether \gls{glsl} shaders can be loaded and executed. It shows the same shader demo provided by the \gls{osg} group.
	\item[\texttt{crfSpaceFlight}]\hfill\\
		This last demo application shows some planets rotating around the sun.
\end{description}

Appendix \ref{sec:appendixDemo} holds screenshots of the expected output for each application.
