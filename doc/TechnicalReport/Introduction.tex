\chapter{Introduction}

This document describes the work of integrating an existing scene graph technology into Equalizer; Starting with the preceding evaluation of eligible scene graph technologies followed by Equalizer specific configurations and ends with a detailed description of the implementation of the developed rendering framework. This document shall advise programmers how to make use of the \gls{crf}.

The use of Equalizer as a parallel rendering framework was a requirement. Advantages as well as disadvantages are discussed later in this document. The group of available scene graph technologies was reduced to two in a former evaluation project. These two were \gls{osg} and \gls{ogre}. Both of them are discussed in the section \nameref{sec:evaluation}.

The purpose of the integration of \gls{osg} into Equalizer is to run any scene graph application in a \gls{vr} installation without any (bigger) changes of the application code. 

All examples and configurations described in this document refer to and were tested in a real virtual reality environment.
