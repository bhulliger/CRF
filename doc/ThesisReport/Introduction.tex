\chapter{Introduction}
Over the past sixteen weeks we worked on a project within the scope of our bachelor thesis. The thesis report shows the reader what we made when we began and how we organised ourselves. Furthermore, we bring up what preparation work needed to be done, how we advanced during the project and how we tested our results. Finally, we point out unachieved goals and summarise an outlook on what could be done in the future.
