\section{Possible Next Steps}
There are several possible follow up projects conceivable. First, a real \gls{osg} application with a practical purpose which uses the currently available \gls{crf} features would bring a lot of benefits. Such a project could point out some useful enhancements and desires. In this context, it is not unlikely that new bugs appear which we could not discover. Therefore, some maintenance tasks are imaginable.

The creation of a derived version of the \gls{crf} could also be an interesting attempt: Actually, it should not be a big deal to integrate another graphic engine instead of \gls{osg} into the \gls{crf}. Such a trial could proof the flexibility of the \gls{crf} and would be worth it. If a different engine like \gls{ogre} provides a similar mechanism like the \gls{osg} viewer, it would be only necessary to change the classes \texttt{eqOsg::Channel}, \texttt{eqOsg::Pipe} and \texttt{crf::crfPipe} to run the \gls{crf} with another graphic engine.
