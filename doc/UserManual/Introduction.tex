\section{Introduction}

This guide should help developers, particularly from the CPVR group, to make use of the \gls{crf}. First of all, if not already done, there is a guide on how to setup the \gls{crf} environment. Basically, this means to install \gls{osg} and Equalizer. There are a lot of dependencies and some tricks to make it work. For that reason, read and follow the instructions carefully.

In a second step, we provide some information on how to develop with the \gls{crf}. You are introduced on what basic implementations you have to make to build your own application based on the \gls{crf}.
