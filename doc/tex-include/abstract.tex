\begin{abstract}
\gls{vr} installations are often limited in rendering performance or flexibility. A common approach to avoid the first problem is the combination of multiple workstations to a cluster. There are several existing software solutions to make usage of such clusters. The technologies applied in the \gls{cave} of the \gls{cpvr} research group are Chromium which is very network intense or a VRML/X3D based solution which does not allow the programmer to take full advantage of \gls{vr} possibilities. 

The goal of this project was to find a solution that enables both the flexible parallel rendering of an application and the unlimited development of OpenGL applications.\\A valuable parallel rendering API could be found in \emph{Equalizer} and \gls{osg} is a high performance 3D graphics toolkit which allows the development of feature-rich OpenGL applications. 

The \gls{crf} provides a library to render OSG applications with Equalizer without further knowledge about parallel rendering or Equalizer. It is compatible with most Equalizer configurations and supports most of the OSG features.
