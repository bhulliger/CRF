With this framework, one is able to render OSG applications with Equalizer.
For further explanations some examples, a technical report and user guide 
should come along with the code. If not, don't hesitate to conatct us!

This simple framework is based on eqOsg - a minimal example published by 
the University of Siegen, 2009.
