==========================

The crfStressTest is an application which can be used to load huge models. It was 
initially written to test the performance of a four wall CAVE (for further information
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Automatic_Virtual_Environment). It loads (huge)
mesh models on each side: on the front, on the left, on the right and on the bottom.

In order to run the crfStressTest properly, the corresponding model files must reside 
somewhere in your environment.

The necessary files are:
- bunny.osg
- armadillo.osg
- buddha.osg
- dragon.osg

The models can be downloaded from http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/. The 
model format is genuinly PLY. In order to load it into the stress test application
you have to convert it to the OSG file format. Use a 3D modeling tool for this 
conversion, e. g. Blender.

A plugin to teach Blender about OSG exports can be found on 
http://projects.blender.org/projects/osgexport/
